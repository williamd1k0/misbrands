The world's most hated IT stickers

![An assortment of various logos that look like other famous brands but actually have their competitors' name](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EC5sIScWkAIUSen?format=png&name=900x900)

(there's more!)

Inspired by Sam Beckham's legendary [JavaScript sticker]( https://samdbeckham.gitlab.io/javascript_sticker/)

## FAQ: 

#### Can I print these?
Of course, that's why those are here.

#### Can I buy these?
Yes, you can! Not from me, but from any custom sticker vendor of your choice.

#### Will there be more?
This is a fork of the original repo that hadn't been updated in some time. I'm
working on adding new logos that were submitted as pull requests to the original
repo.

Anyone is also welcome to submit new pull requests to this repo directly.

When submitting a pull request please follow these naming conventions:
`[text]-[logo name]`

Example: The text says python in the logo style of php.
`python-php.svg`

If there is a file with that name already existing simply add a dash and a
number starting with 02 and incrementing up from there.

Example: You submit a logo that says emacs in the style of the vim logo.
There is already an `emacs-vim.svg` in the repo.
Name your file `emacs-vim-02.svg`.

#### TODO
- [ ] Finish importing pull requests
- [x] Naming conventions
- [ ] Standard image size
